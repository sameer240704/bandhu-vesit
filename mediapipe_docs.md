Overview
The ability to perceive the shape and motion of hands can be a vital component in improving the user experience across a variety of technological domains and platforms. For example, it can form the basis for sign language understanding and hand gesture control, and can also enable the overlay of digital content and information on top of the physical world in augmented reality. While coming naturally to people, robust real-time hand perception is a decidedly challenging computer vision task, as hands often occlude themselves or each other (e.g. finger/palm occlusions and hand shakes) and lack high contrast patterns.

MediaPipe Hands is a high-fidelity hand and finger tracking solution. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer 21 3D landmarks of a hand from just a single frame. Whereas current state-of-the-art approaches rely primarily on powerful desktop environments for inference, our method achieves real-time performance on a mobile phone, and even scales to multiple hands. We hope that providing this hand perception functionality to the wider research and development community will result in an emergence of creative use cases, stimulating new applications and new research avenues.

ML Pipeline
MediaPipe Hands utilizes an ML pipeline consisting of multiple models working together: A palm detection model that operates on the full image and returns an oriented hand bounding box. A hand landmark model that operates on the cropped image region defined by the palm detector and returns high-fidelity 3D hand keypoints. This strategy is similar to that employed in our MediaPipe Face Mesh solution, which uses a face detector together with a face landmark model.

Providing the accurately cropped hand image to the hand landmark model drastically reduces the need for data augmentation (e.g. rotations, translation and scale) and instead allows the network to dedicate most of its capacity towards coordinate prediction accuracy. In addition, in our pipeline the crops can also be generated based on the hand landmarks identified in the previous frame, and only when the landmark model could no longer identify hand presence is palm detection invoked to relocalize the hand.

The pipeline is implemented as a MediaPipe graph that uses a hand landmark tracking subgraph from the hand landmark module, and renders using a dedicated hand renderer subgraph. The hand landmark tracking subgraph internally uses a hand landmark subgraph from the same module and a palm detection subgraph from the palm detection module.

Note: To visualize a graph, copy the graph and paste it into MediaPipe Visualizer. For more information on how to visualize its associated subgraphs, please see visualizer documentation.

Models
Palm Detection Model
To detect initial hand locations, we designed a single-shot detector model optimized for mobile real-time uses in a manner similar to the face detection model in MediaPipe Face Mesh. Detecting hands is a decidedly complex task: our lite model and full model have to work across a variety of hand sizes with a large scale span (~20x) relative to the image frame and be able to detect occluded and self-occluded hands. Whereas faces have high contrast patterns, e.g., in the eye and mouth region, the lack of such features in hands makes it comparatively difficult to detect them reliably from their visual features alone. Instead, providing additional context, like arm, body, or person features, aids accurate hand localization.

Our method addresses the above challenges using different strategies. First, we train a palm detector instead of a hand detector, since estimating bounding boxes of rigid objects like palms and fists is significantly simpler than detecting hands with articulated fingers. In addition, as palms are smaller objects, the non-maximum suppression algorithm works well even for two-hand self-occlusion cases, like handshakes. Moreover, palms can be modelled using square bounding boxes (anchors in ML terminology) ignoring other aspect ratios, and therefore reducing the number of anchors by a factor of 3-5. Second, an encoder-decoder feature extractor is used for bigger scene context awareness even for small objects (similar to the RetinaNet approach). Lastly, we minimize the focal loss during training to support a large amount of anchors resulting from the high scale variance.

With the above techniques, we achieve an average precision of 95.7% in palm detection. Using a regular cross entropy loss and no decoder gives a baseline of just 86.22%.

Hand Landmark Model
After the palm detection over the whole image our subsequent hand landmark model performs precise keypoint localization of 21 3D hand-knuckle coordinates inside the detected hand regions via regression, that is direct coordinate prediction. The model learns a consistent internal hand pose representation and is robust even to partially visible hands and self-occlusions.

To obtain ground truth data, we have manually annotated ~30K real-world images with 21 3D coordinates, as shown below (we take Z-value from image depth map, if it exists per corresponding coordinate). To better cover the possible hand poses and provide additional supervision on the nature of hand geometry, we also render a high-quality synthetic hand model over various backgrounds and map it to the corresponding 3D coordinates.

Solution APIs
Configuration Options
Naming style and availability may differ slightly across platforms/languages.

static_image_mode
If set to false, the solution treats the input images as a video stream. It will try to detect hands in the first input images, and upon a successful detection further localizes the hand landmarks. In subsequent images, once all max_num_hands hands are detected and the corresponding hand landmarks are localized, it simply tracks those landmarks without invoking another detection until it loses track of any of the hands. This reduces latency and is ideal for processing video frames. If set to true, hand detection runs on every input image, ideal for processing a batch of static, possibly unrelated, images. Default to false.

max_num_hands
Maximum number of hands to detect. Default to 2.

model_complexity
Complexity of the hand landmark model: 0 or 1. Landmark accuracy as well as inference latency generally go up with the model complexity. Default to 1.

min_detection_confidence
Minimum confidence value ([0.0, 1.0]) from the hand detection model for the detection to be considered successful. Default to 0.5.

min_tracking_confidence:
Minimum confidence value ([0.0, 1.0]) from the landmark-tracking model for the hand landmarks to be considered tracked successfully, or otherwise hand detection will be invoked automatically on the next input image. Setting it to a higher value can increase robustness of the solution, at the expense of a higher latency. Ignored if static_image_mode is true, where hand detection simply runs on every image. Default to 0.5.

Output
Naming style may differ slightly across platforms/languages.

multi_hand_landmarks
Collection of detected/tracked hands, where each hand is represented as a list of 21 hand landmarks and each landmark is composed of x, y and z. x and y are normalized to [0.0, 1.0] by the image width and height respectively. z represents the landmark depth with the depth at the wrist being the origin, and the smaller the value the closer the landmark is to the camera. The magnitude of z uses roughly the same scale as x.

multi_hand_world_landmarks
Collection of detected/tracked hands, where each hand is represented as a list of 21 hand landmarks in world coordinates. Each landmark is composed of x, y and z: real-world 3D coordinates in meters with the origin at the hand's approximate geometric center.

multi_handedness
Collection of handedness of the detected/tracked hands (i.e. is it a left or right hand). Each hand is composed of label and score. label is a string of value either "Left" or "Right". score is the estimated probability of the predicted handedness and is always greater than or equal to 0.5 (and the opposite handedness has an estimated probability of 1 - score).

Note that handedness is determined assuming the input image is mirrored, i.e., taken with a front-facing/selfie camera with images flipped horizontally. If it is not the case, please swap the handedness output in the application.

## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

MediaPipe Hands is a high-fidelity hand and finger tracking solution.  It leverages machine learning (ML) to infer 21 3D landmarks of a hand from just a single frame.  This JavaScript library allows you to easily integrate this powerful technology into your web projects, enabling applications like gesture control, virtual reality interaction, sign language recognition, and more.

## 2. Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You can install the necessary MediaPipe packages using npm or yarn, or you can include them directly via CDN links.

**Using npm (Recommended for larger projects):**

```bash
npm install @mediapipe/camera_utils @mediapipe/control_utils @mediapipe/drawing_utils @mediapipe/hands
```

**Using yarn:**

```bash
yarn add @mediapipe/camera_utils @mediapipe/control_utils @mediapipe/drawing_utils @mediapipe/hands
```

**Using CDN (Suitable for quick prototyping):**

You'll need to include these scripts in your HTML file (within the `<head>` tag):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/camera_utils/camera_utils.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/control_utils/control_utils.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/drawing_utils/drawing_utils.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/hands/hands.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

## 3. Basic Usage <a name="basic-usage"></a>

### 3.1. Setting up the HTML Structure <a name="html-structure"></a>

Create an HTML file with the following basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MediaPipe Hands Example</title>
  </head>
<body>
  <video class="input_video" style="display:none;"></video>
  <canvas class="output_canvas" width="1280px" height="720px"></canvas>

  <script src="script.js"></script>  </body>
</html>
```

*   **`<video>`:** This element will capture the video stream from the user's webcam. It's hidden by default ( `style="display:none;"`) because we'll be drawing the processed output on the canvas.  You can remove `display:none;` if you want to see the raw video feed.
*   **`<canvas>`:** This is where we will render the detected hand landmarks and other visualizations. The width and height should match your desired output resolution.
*   **`<script src="script.js"></script>`:**  This links to your JavaScript file where the MediaPipe logic will reside.

### 3.2.  Including the JavaScript Libraries <a name="javascript-libraries"></a>

If you used npm or yarn, import the modules at the top of your `script.js` file:

```javascript
import { Hands } from "@mediapipe/hands";
import { Camera } from "@mediapipe/camera_utils";
import { drawConnectors, drawLandmarks } from "@mediapipe/drawing_utils";
import { HAND_CONNECTIONS } from "@mediapipe/hands";
```

If you used CDN links, these libraries are already globally available, so you don't need the `import` statements.

### 3.3. Initializing the Hands Solution <a name="initializing-hands"></a>

In your `script.js` file, initialize the `Hands` object:

```javascript
const videoElement = document.getElementsByClassName('input_video')[0];
const canvasElement = document.getElementsByClassName('output_canvas')[0];
const canvasCtx = canvasElement.getContext('2d');

const hands = new Hands({locateFile: (file) => {
  return `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/hands/${file}`; // For CDN.  Adjust if using local files.
}});

hands.setOptions({
  maxNumHands: 2,             // Maximum number of hands to detect
  modelComplexity: 1,        // Model complexity (0 or 1)
  minDetectionConfidence: 0.5, // Minimum confidence for hand detection
  minTrackingConfidence: 0.5  // Minimum confidence for hand tracking
});
```

*   `locateFile`: This function is crucial. It tells MediaPipe where to find the necessary WASM files and model data. The example above is for the CDN; if you have installed via npm and are using a bundler like Webpack, the bundler usually handles this automatically (you might need to configure it to copy the files).  If you are serving the files locally without a bundler, adjust the path accordingly (e.g., `return \`/path/to/your/files/${file}\`;`).
*   `setOptions`:  This method configures the `Hands` object. We'll discuss these options in detail in the "Advanced Configurations" section.

### 3.4. Processing Video Input <a name="processing-video-input"></a>

Set up the `onResults` callback function, which will be executed whenever MediaPipe Hands detects hands in a frame:

```javascript
hands.onResults(onResults);
```

Then, set up the camera and start processing the video stream:

```javascript
const camera = new Camera(videoElement, {
  onFrame: async () => {
    await hands.send({image: videoElement});
  },
  width: 1280,
  height: 720
});
camera.start();
```

*   `onFrame`: This is an asynchronous function that's called for each frame from the camera.  Inside `onFrame`, we use `hands.send({image: videoElement})` to send the current video frame to the MediaPipe Hands solution for processing. The `await` keyword ensures that the processing completes before the next frame is sent.
*   `width` and `height`:  These should match the dimensions of your canvas and the desired video resolution.

### 3.5. Handling Results (Landmark Detection) <a name="handling-results"></a>

Define the `onResults` function to handle the detected landmarks:

```javascript
function onResults(results) {
  canvasCtx.save();
  canvasCtx.clearRect(0, 0, canvasElement.width, canvasElement.height);
  canvasCtx.drawImage(
      results.image, 0, 0, canvasElement.width, canvasElement.height);

  if (results.multiHandLandmarks) {
    for (const landmarks of results.multiHandLandmarks) {
      // Access individual landmarks here:
      // landmarks[0] is the wrist, landmarks[4] is the thumb tip, etc.
      // Example: Get the x, y coordinates of the index finger tip (landmark 8):
      // const indexTipX = landmarks[8].x * canvasElement.width;
      // const indexTipY = landmarks[8].y * canvasElement.height;

        drawConnectors(canvasCtx, landmarks, HAND_CONNECTIONS, {color: '#00FF00', lineWidth: 5});
        drawLandmarks(canvasCtx, landmarks, {color: '#FF0000', lineWidth: 2});
    }
  }
  canvasCtx.restore();
}
```

*   `canvasCtx.clearRect()`: Clears the canvas before drawing the new frame.
*   `canvasCtx.drawImage()`:  Draws the video frame onto the canvas. This is optional but often useful for visual debugging.
*   `results.multiHandLandmarks`: This array contains the detected hand landmarks for each hand.  Each element in the array is another array of 21 landmarks, representing the 3D coordinates (x, y, z) of each key point on the hand.
*   `landmarks[i].x`, `landmarks[i].y`, `landmarks[i].z`:  These are the normalized coordinates of the i-th landmark.  `x` and `y` are normalized to `[0.0, 1.0]` by the image width and height, respectively. `z` represents the landmark depth, with the depth at the wrist being the origin.  Smaller values represent closer to the camera.
*  We draw the connections and the landmarks using built-in functions from `@mediapipe/drawing_utils`

### 3.6. Drawing Landmarks on the Canvas <a name="drawing-landmarks"></a>

The code within the `if (results.multiHandLandmarks)` block in the `onResults` function already handles drawing the landmarks and connections between them using the `drawConnectors` and `drawLandmarks` functions.

## 4. Advanced Configurations <a name="advanced-configurations"></a>

The `hands.setOptions()` method allows you to fine-tune the behavior of the hand detection model:

*   **`maxNumHands` (default: 2):**  The maximum number of hands to detect.  Reducing this can improve performance if you only need to track one hand.
*   **`modelComplexity` (default: 1):**  Controls the complexity of the hand landmark model.  `0` is lighter and faster, while `1` is more accurate but requires more computation.
*   **`minDetectionConfidence` (default: 0.5):**  The minimum confidence value (between 0 and 1) for a hand detection to be considered successful.  Increasing this can reduce false positives but may also miss some detections.
*   **`minTrackingConfidence` (default: 0.5):**  The minimum confidence value for hand tracking to be considered successful.  This determines how well the model maintains tracking of a hand across frames.  If the confidence drops below this value, the model will attempt to re-detect the hand in the next frame.

## 5. Practical Examples <a name="practical-examples"></a>

### 5.1. Example 1: Basic Hand Detection and Drawing <a name="example-1-basic-hand-detection-and-drawing"></a>

This is a complete, runnable example combining all the steps above:

    const videoElement = document.getElementsByClassName('input_video')[0];
    const canvasElement = document.getElementsByClassName('output_canvas')[0];
    const canvasCtx = canvasElement.getContext('2d');

    const hands = new Hands({locateFile: (file) => {
      return `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/hands/${file}`;
    }});

    hands.setOptions({
      maxNumHands: 2,
      modelComplexity: 1,
      minDetectionConfidence: 0.5,
      minTrackingConfidence: 0.5
    });

    hands.onResults(onResults);

    const camera = new Camera(videoElement, {
      onFrame: async () => {
        await hands.send({image: videoElement});
      },
      width: 1280,
      height: 720
    });
    camera.start();

    function onResults(results) {
      canvasCtx.save();
      canvasCtx.clearRect(0, 0, canvasElement.width, canvasElement.height);
      canvasCtx.drawImage(
          results.image, 0, 0, canvasElement.width, canvasElement.height);
      if (results.multiHandLandmarks) {
        for (const landmarks of results.multiHandLandmarks) {
          drawConnectors(canvasCtx, landmarks, HAND_CONNECTIONS,
                         {color: '#00FF00', lineWidth: 5});
          drawLandmarks(canvasCtx, landmarks, {color: '#FF0000', lineWidth: 2});
        }
      }
      canvasCtx.restore();
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 5.2. Example 2: Hand Gesture Recognition (Basic) <a name="example-2-hand-gesture-recognition-basic"></a> (Conceptual Outline)

This example outlines how to perform *basic* gesture recognition.  For robust gesture recognition, you'll typically want to train a custom machine learning model.

```javascript
// ... (previous code from Example 1) ...

function onResults(results) {
  // ... (canvas drawing code) ...

  if (results.multiHandLandmarks) {
    for (const landmarks of results.multiHandLandmarks) {
      // ... (drawing code) ...

      // Basic Gesture Recognition (Example: Thumbs Up)
      const thumbTip = landmarks[4];
      const thumbIp = landmarks[3];
      const thumbCmc = landmarks[1];

      const indexTip = landmarks[8];

      //Check if thumb is higher than other thumb joints
      if(thumbTip.y < thumbIp.y && thumbTip.y < thumbCmc.y && thumbTip.y < indexTip.y){
        // Display "Thumbs Up!" on the canvas
        canvasCtx.font = '30px Arial';
        canvasCtx.fillStyle = 'blue';
        canvasCtx.fillText('Thumbs Up!', 50, 50);
      }
    }
  }

  // ... (rest of the onResults function) ...
}
```

This example demonstrates a *very* basic "thumbs-up" gesture detection by checking if the thumb tip's y-coordinate is higher than other joints in the thumb, and the index finger.  This is a simplified example and won't be robust in all situations. You'll need to consider:

*   **Multiple Gestures:**  Implement logic to differentiate between various gestures.
*   **Orientation:**  The hand's orientation (palm up, down, sideways) will affect the landmark coordinates. You might need to use relative positions and angles between landmarks.
*   **Robustness:**  Simple coordinate comparisons are often insufficient.  You'll likely need to use more sophisticated techniques, such as calculating distances between landmarks, angles between fingers, or using a machine learning classifier trained on a dataset of labeled hand gestures.
*   **Temporal Consistency:** Track the gesture over multiple frames to avoid flickering detections.  Use a state machine or smoothing techniques.

## 6. Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>

*   **"Cannot find module" or "Module not found" errors:**  Ensure you've installed the packages correctly using npm/yarn, and that your import paths are correct.  If using CDNs, double-check the script tags and ensure you have a stable internet connection.
*   **WASM errors:** If you're getting errors related to WASM files, make sure the `locateFile` function is correctly pointing to the location of the MediaPipe WASM files.  If you are serving files locally, be sure the server is configured to serve `.wasm` files with the correct MIME type (`application/wasm`).
*   **No hand detection:**
    *   Ensure your camera is working and that you've granted the website permission to access it.
    *   Check the `minDetectionConfidence` and `minTrackingConfidence` settings.  Lowering these values might help with initial detection.
    *   Make sure the lighting conditions are adequate.  MediaPipe Hands works best with good, even lighting.
    *   Verify that the hand is within the camera's view and is not obstructed.
*   **Performance issues:** See the "Performance Considerations" section below.
*   **Camera not starting:** Check your browser's developer console for any error messages related to camera access. Ensure no other applications are using the camera.

## 7. Performance Considerations <a name="performance-considerations"></a>

*   **Reduce `maxNumHands`:** If you only need to track one hand, set `maxNumHands` to 1.
*   **Use `modelComplexity: 0`:** This uses a lighter model, which is faster but less accurate.
*   **Optimize video resolution:** Lowering the `width` and `height` of the video and canvas will reduce the processing load.  Find a balance between resolution and performance.
*   **Throttle frame processing:** Instead of processing every frame, you could process every other frame, or use a `requestAnimationFrame` loop with a timer to control the processing rate.
*   **Offload to a Web Worker:** For complex gesture recognition or other computationally intensive tasks, consider using a Web Worker to run the processing in a separate thread, preventing the main thread from becoming blocked.
*   **Use GPU (if available):** MediaPipe.js can leverage the GPU for accelerated processing if the user's browser and hardware support it. This is usually handled automatically.
